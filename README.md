# Grade Manager

The Grade Manager web application allows users to keep track of their grades.
Users will be able to add courses and their assignments.
Grades attached to those classes will be calculated.

#Adding an screenshot or a mockup of your application in action would be nice.

# Getting Started with Create React App


### How to build ###

* Using this github repository: https://github.com/cis3296s22/GradeManager download into local Javascript IDE from the green button marked "Code", click on Download Zip. Another option is to download the code via the release towards the right of the page. Choose the "Source code.zip" option. After extraction, open the folder in your Javascript IDE. 

In order to get this project started, you will first need to download Node. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and select the "Recommended For Most Users" button and download the current version for your operating system. 

* After download is complete, using the main branch, go to your Javascript IDE (example Visual Code) and go to your command line or terminal and enter:
```
npm -v
```
* This will present you with the version of NPM installed. Check to see if your version is above 5.2.0. If not, run:
```
npm install -g npm
```
* To install Create-React-App run:
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

* If the program gives you errors when trying to run, use either of these:
```
npm start
```
```
npm run start
```
```
npm run
```

* Make sure you are in gradeManager/prj-grademanager/grade_manager

* If it is still giving an error, more than likely the update didn't install all the necessary dependencies. Try running any of these:
```
npm updates
```
```
 npm install
 ```
 or 
```
npm install updates
```
 * then try: 
```
npm start
```
```
npm run start
```
or 
```
npm run
```

* If everything runs successfully, you should be brought to the localhost through a webpage that shows this project.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run build` fails to minify

This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)


- On the command line run with
```
npm run start
```
- You will see the user interface on the loopback network protocal, http://localhost:3000/
