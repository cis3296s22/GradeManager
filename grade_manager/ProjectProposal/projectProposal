Vision Statement:
This application will allow users, including students and teachers to see their grades.

For students who want to examine their grades and plan ahead for study schedules. The grade manager
is a web application that will allow students to put all their courses and assignments in place to better keep 
track of their grades. Unlike other applications Grade Manager will allow students to independently keep track of their grades.


Annie, age 18, is a new student at Temple University. She's lived in 
Philadelphia all her life where her parents work as doctors. 
She is really anxious about getting good grades for her first semester. 
She's been using her university's application to keep track of her grades, 
but she wants a separate application that will let her add assignments herself to 
plan for future assignments and hypothetical situations.


Chris, age 19, is a sophomore in university and has a tendency to slack off during the semester. 
Because of this, he frequently tries to calculate his grade in the middle and end of the semester
to see how to make up for a bad start. He needs a tool that can store his grades and how they change,
as well as predict his final grades. Chris will use the grade manager on a need by need basis instead of 
as a consistent tracker.


Persona - Returning Student
Chris Hemsworth, age 20, a resident of Philadelphia, is a returning college student to Alekhine University. 
He joined Temple University when he was 18, majoring in Electrical Engineering alongside playing varsity football for the university. 
While playing he found himself in an injury, forcing him to take a year-long gap from the university. 
Now fully fit, Chris has enrolled himself back in the university and has taken 5 classes for his upcoming semester. 

Being aware that all of his courses require him to take multiple quizzes, homework, assignments, and midterms maybe extra-credit, curves, the lowest grade being dropped, 
he starts looking for an effective way of managing his grades and opts to use the Grade Manager as a realiable form of grade manager application.  
He finds the interface easy to use and is easily able to view the actual and potential grades for all of his courses. 


Persona - Busy Student
Marie Rotman just moved in to the United States and she just enrolled at Temple University as a full time student.  On the other side
she also works full time so her schedule is very busy.
