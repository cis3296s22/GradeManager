Annie, age 18, is a new student at Temple University. She's lived in 
Philadelphia all her life where her parents work as doctors.

Chris, age 19, is a sophomore in university and has a tendency to slack off during the semester. 
Because of this, he frequently tries to calculate his grade in the middle and end of the semester

as well as predict his final grades. Chris will use the grade manager on a need by need basis instead of 
as a consistent tracker.
